        <p class='inter-text text-black-50 mb-0' align='justify'>An in-depth analysis showed us some examples where the language is not used in a neutral way to portray men and women. For example, think of the famous couple: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both have astonishing careers. They have been married for a while now and have 2 children together. 

        </p>

        <p class='inter-text text-black-50 mb-0' align='justify'> If you look at the overview sections on their Wikipedia biographies, you can spot some differences in terms of the words used to describe them.

                <p class='mb-0 text-black-50' align='justify'>[...] Zeta-Jones established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her <span class="highlight-red">sex appeal</span>, such as in the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the heist film Entrapment (1999). She received acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in Traffic (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical Chicago (2002); for the latter she won Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actress.</p>

                <h4 class='text-black'>Michael Kirk Douglas</h4>
                <p class='mb-0 text-black-50' align='justify'>Michael Kirk Douglas (born September 25, 1944) is an American actor and producer. He has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and the AFI Life Achievement Award. </p>

                <p class='mb-0 text-black-50' align='justify'>[...] Douglas received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p>

                <p class='mb-0 text-black-50' align='justify'>[...] Apart from his acting career, Douglas has received notice for his <span class="text-dark-brown">humanitarian and political activism</span>, as well as media attention for his <span class="text-dark-brown">marriage</span> to Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.</p>
                <hr class='d-none d-lg-block mb-0 ml-0'>

      </div>


        <p class='inter-text text-black-50 mb-0' align='justify'>We can see that, in both cases, their origin and acting careers are well described. But then, also some differences are easy to spot.
        For her, we can find references to her struggle with depression, her physical appearance and the fact that she is married to Michael Douglas and has two children with him. On the contrary, the extra information given for Michael Douglas refers to his accomplishments and other awards, a reference to his marriage by the end but nothing about his children.</p>

        <p class='inter-text text-black-50 mb-0' align='justify'>Being one of the most viewed sources of information in the world doesn't mean being completly neutral in some sense. Nevertheless, Wikipedia is built thanks to non-professional contributions and therefore might be harder to control. Letâ€™s not forget that these details are very subtle and that they are written on an subconsciously manner, as gender gap is a fact in our society and in the way humans grow up.  </p>
